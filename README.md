# Churn
This is DistAlgo implementation and testing of Churn algorithm defined in the paper 
"Emulating a Shared Register in a System That Never Stops Changing", IEEE TRANSACTIONS
ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS, VOL. 30, NO. 3, MARCH 2019, pp. 544-559, Hagit Attiya
, Hyun Chul Chung, Faith Ellen, Saptaparni Kumar, and Jennifer L. Welch

# Requirements
## Python
DistAlgo requires Python version 3.5 or higher.
## DistAlgo
DistAlgo is a very high-level language for programming distributed algorithms.
Installation step: https://github.com/DistAlgo/distalgo/blob/c58d13c61fc115cad3c1eac05fbb3645095e7671/README.md
The repo is tested on pyDistAlgo version 1.0.13.

# Running the program
The paper defines a range of permissible values of (…ë, ùõÉ, ùû¨, Œî, D). The simulation can 
assume any value of the parameter within this range. The step size, begin and
end is define for each of these parameters.

For performance testing, the test needs to be repeated for multiple range of
these values. In the single run of the program, it iterates through all the values
of anyone of the chosen parameter.

Apart from the above parameters there are other system parameters defined for the simulation:
- Node_count - number of nodes at the start of the simulation.
- sleep_time_node - number of seconds the node is sent to sleep.
- Max_delay - maximum amount of time taken for transmitting message (D).
- num_of_rounds - number of times the all the tests need to be repeated.
- num_read_writes - number of times read/write test is performed.
- churn_count - number of times leave/join test is performed.
- Retention_limit - number
