DOES THIS WORK WITH N=1?
If there's no ID in the enter-echo message, they can be spoofed

- Make each node spontaneously read/write values into the register. This ||ism will break the code
- Randomize based on a frequency and time that can be adjusted. 

while(True):
    read_or_write = random.randint(1)

- For two consecutive writes  (in a short time span) it considers on the second because the tag is overwritten. This could be a problem
- Node randomly crashes
